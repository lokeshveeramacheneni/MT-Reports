    \chapter{State of the Art}
    In this chapter, we will discuss about the 3D LiDAR datasets available and made an attempt to classify them based on type of acquisition.
    Also we will discuss about the 3D semantic segmentation models, uncertainty estimation methods and OOD methods available.
    \section{3D LiDAR Datasets}
    %Since the advent of AlexNet \cite{alexnet}, deeplearning has been in the rise. 
    %Deep convolutional neural networks are the desired option for image analysis tasks such as classification, detection and segmentation.
    %These deep convolutional networks are successful especially because of two reasons. 
    %First is the architectures and their paralellisation, allowing them to train millions of images on a GPU.
    %Second reason is the development of huge public benchmark datasets such as Imagenet \cite{imagenet}, Pascal VOC \cite{pascalvoc} and COCO \cite{coco} datasets
    %Although deep convolutional networks are huge success in image analysis tasks, they perform poorly on 3D point cloud data.
    LiDAR is one of the central component in the sensor suite for SLAM system in robotic applications \cite{thrun2006stanley}, \cite{patz2008practical}, \cite{hess20162dSLAM} and autonomous driving \cite{li2016vehicle}.
    3D LiDAR data is preferred because, it can provide the exact replica of 3D geometry of the real world represented in the form of 3D point clouds.
    Because of these rich features and widespread use of LiDAR sensors, tasks such as 3D object detection \cite{zhou2018voxelnet}, \cite{PIXOR} and 3D semantic segmentation \cite{qi2017pointnet++}, \cite{3Dmininet} are becoming more predominant area for research.
    
    In this section, we will discuss about the available 3D LiDAR datasets for 3D semantic segmentation task and classify the datasets based on acquisition methods as in \cite{survey3d}.
    \cite{survey3d} classifies the available public datasets into three classes based on the data acquisition process.
    They are \textit{Sequential}, \textit{Static} and \textit{Synthetic} datasets.
    The data for sequential datasets are collected as frame sequences where mechanical LiDAR is mounted on top of a autonomous driivng platform as in Figure \ref{fig:seq_data_lyft}.
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/sequential_lyft.png}
        \caption{Sequential mounted LiDAR for data collection of Lyft L5 dataset. Image from \cite{Lyftl5}}
        \label{fig:seq_data_lyft}
    \end{figure}
    Most of the popular autonomous driving datasets are of sequential type, but these kind of datasets comes with a drawback of sparse points than other datasets.
    
    Static datasets consists of data collected from a stationary view point by a terrestrial laser scanner.
    These kind of datasets capture the static information of the realworld whereas the sequential datasets capture the dynamic movements of the surrounding objects.
    Static datasets find their way in applications such as the urban planning, augmented reality and robotics. 
    Figure \ref{fig:tls} depcits a terrestrial laser scanner used to capture point cloud of an industrial environment.
    \begin{figure}[h!]

        \caption{Terrestrial laser scanner in an industrial environment with the laser scanner mounted on a yellow tripod in the left corner of the floor. Image taken from \cite{tls}}
        \label{fig:tls}
    \end{figure}
    An advantage with the static datasets, are they can produce highly dense point clouds leading to rich 3D geometric representations.
    
    Last type of 3D LiDAR datasets are synthetic datasets. 
    As the name suggests these datasets are generated from the computer simulation. 
    Figure \ref{fig:synthetic} depcits a simulated point cloud in a synthtic dataset called SynthCity.
    Eventhough synthetic datasets can be generated in large scale with cheap cost, they lack the accuracy in detail when compared to the point clouds generated from real world.

        \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{images/synthcity.png}
        \caption{Illustration of a scene in synthetic dataset called SynthCity. Image taken from \cite{griffiths2019synthcity}}
        \label{fig:synthetic}
    \end{figure}
    
    The datasets belonging to the each acquisition type are summed up in  Table \ref{table:3d_lidar_datasets_table}.
    Most of the datasets from the Table \ref{table:3d_lidar_datasets_table} are taken from \cite{survey3d} and also as a part of this study, additional new datasets were added to the list.
    The newly added datasets include DALES \cite{varney2020dales}, ScanObjectNN \cite{scanobejctnn} in static acquisition mode and AIO Drive \cite{Weng2020_AIODrive}, Toronto3D \cite{tan2020toronto3d} are additions in the sequential mode.
    \cite{survey3d} also classifies GTAV \textcolor{red}{\textbf{cite}} dataset as synthetic 3D LiDAR but the corresponding paper doesn't report any LiDAR dataset and proposed only 2D dataset for segmentation.
    The limited number of datasets in 3D LiDAR allowed us to study the characteristics of each individual datasets such as each class, data distribution and features of each point in point cloud. 
    It is summarized in Table \textcolor{red}{\textbf{ref}} in Appendix \textcolor{red}{\textbf{chapter number}}

    \section{3D semantic segmentation models}

In this section, we will discuss about the methods available for 3D semantic segmentation.
The discussion include a breif peek into traditional 3D semantic segmentation methods and study of deep learning based 3D point cloud segmentation.

Traditional methods involve a complex features extraction and pass these features to a classficiation algorithm such as Support Vector Machines or Random Forests to classify each point the point cloud.
Various authors developed variety of methods to extract the features from the input point cloud.
Some of these methods include segmentation from edge information \cite{bhanu1986range}, construction of complex graph pyramids \cite{koster}.
3D Hough transforms as in \cite{vosselman20013d} and application of RANSAC \cite{schnabel2007efficient} and \cite{tarsha2007hough}.
These traditional methods are now outdated as DNNs proved to better at feature extraction.

\subsection{Deep learning based 3D semantic segmentation}
Deep learning based models are efficient at segmentation and can be divided into three types.
Initial type include the point based models where the model directly feeds on the 3D point cloud.
Then the other type include projection based models where the model takes in a projected points into 2D image either a range image or bird's eye view.
Final type of models include the use of graph neural networks.
Point based models mostly utilize fully connected layer or convolutional layers. 
Where as the projection based models utilize existing 2D semantic segmentation archiecture.
The detailed summary of each model belonging to these two categories are depicted in Table \ref{tab:model_relatedwork} along with number of parameters.
Finally, graph neural networks are out of the scope for this project and will not be disucssed further.

    \section{Uncertainty estimation methods}
    In this section we will discuss about existing methods to estimate uncertainty in deep neural networks.
    Here we divide the existing methods into ensemble methods, bayesian method and others.
    The methods discussed here mostly estimate epistemic uncertainty only test time augmentation and gaussian density models estimate aleatoric unceratinty.
    \subsection{Ensemble methods}
    Deep ensembles first proposed in  \cite{lakshminarayanan2016simple} are the most prominently used methods for the uncertainty estimation.
    They exploit the combinatory power of multiple models. Each input is fed into a model with multiple instances and the each instance of the model is initalized randomly.
    This leads to slightly different optimization for each of the instance of the model. The final output scores from each model are combined by simple averaging.
    Deep ensembles are known to improve overall performance of the model but comes with a cost of computational complexity and resource intensiveness.
    Another advantage of using deep ensembled are the lowest correaltion between the model instances as the training of the instances are done differently.
    This lower correlation figures lead to diverse prediction from each model instance.
    In detailed explantion about deep ensembles can be found in Chapter \textcolor{red}{cite} Section \textcolor{red}{cite}.

    Because of the higher computational complexity and resource intensiveness, multiple flavours of the deep ensembles are proposed such as deep sub-ensembles \textcolor{red}{cite} and masksembles \textcolor{red}{cite}.
    In deep sub-ensembles, the network is divided into two parts called trunk and head.
    The main idea here is to train multiple instances of the head with the same trunk. For example, a trunk can be feature extraction layers in a deep classification network and the head can be the classification layers.
    Since the major motivation of the subensembles is to improve the training speed the performance lacks minutely when compared to deep ensembles as it is a tradeoff between the computational time and quality of uncertainty.
    Masksembles proposed in \textcolor{red}{cite} are realtively new and are a combination of deep ensembles with MC-Dropout.
    Dropout proposed in \textcolor{red}{cite} includes dropping of random neurons where as here a predefined mask is stated for each layer and only those certain neurons are to be dropped everytime.

    Other methods include snapshot ensembles \textcolor{red}{cite} which iterates over the multiple local optima in the optimization landscape using cyclic learning rate. 
    The model parameters are saved at each of the local optima. 
    All of the other flavors of deep ensembles are proposed in order to reduce the effect on time but the memory requirements remain mostly the same except the subensembles.
    The other problem with snapshot ensembles are the optimization landscape in deep neural networks are poorly studied, so there one cannot say with certainty that model saved at two local minima are uncorrelated.
    There also exists neural ensemble search \textcolor{red}{cite} where the nerual archiecture search is applied over the ensembles.
    Instead of using various instances of the same model, authors in \textcolor{red}{cite above paper} use vaiours instances of various models in the archiecture search space.
    Finally, all the above discussed ensmeble models can be group under sampling based methods, because each image is passed to mulitple model instances.    

    \subsection{Bayesian methods}
    Existing neural networks are trained in maximum likelihood manner resulting in a point estimates for the weights.
    The main idea behind bayesian neural networks are to use a distribution over the network parameters.
    That is instead of single fixed weight tesnor for a layer in neural network, a weight tensor is drawn from the distribution for each forward pass.
    The parameters are estimated for input during training by using bayes rule and expressed in Equation \textcolor{red}{cite eq here}.
    $$p(\theta|x, y) = \frac{p(y|x, \theta)p(\theta)}{p(y|x)} = \frac{p(y|x, \theta)p(\theta)}{\int p(y|x, \theta) p(\theta) d\theta}$$
    Here $\theta$ represents network parameters (weights), $p(\theta)$ represents prior distribution over $\theta$, and x and y represents the input data, in our case point cloud and its corresponding semantic point labels
    During inference, the labels are calculated by bayesian model averaging as given in below equation.
    $$p(y_t|x_t, x, y) = \int p(y_t|x_t, \theta)p(\theta|x, y)d\theta$$
    Here $\theta$ represents trained network parameters, x and y represents training set, and $x_t$ and $y_t$ represents the test set.
    The integral in the Equation \textcolor{red}{cite eq here} cannont be computed because $\theta$ is the continous space and so iterating over all possible values of $\theta$ are not feasible.
    So to acheive tractable $\theta$, there exists various  approximation methods such as Variational Inference (VI), Laplace approxoimation and sampling methods such as Monte Carlo sampling.

    VI is a approximation method where the posterior probability $p(\theta|x, y)$ is approximated by specific distribtions represented by $q(\theta)$.
    Kullback-Liebler Divergence (KLD) is used as a measure to calculate the difference between the two distributions. 
    Since KLD cannot be optimized directly becuase of posterior distribution, a function called Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO) similar to KLD is proposed.
    \textcolor{red}{cite} representes the $q(\theta)$ as a gaussian approximation and \textcolor{red}{cite} proposed bayes by backprop to extend stochastic VI for non gaussian priors.
    \textcolor{red}{cite} provides stochastic variational inference that is ELBO loss over mini-batch of data and also assumed the network parameter priors are to be gaussian.
    \textcolor{red}{cite} makes use of reparameterization trick for reduction in variance in gradients. This lead to reformulation of ELBO loss which made it compatible to standard backpropogation.
    \textcolor{red}{Talk about normalizing flows.}

    Another widely known example for VI is Monte Carlo Dropout (MC-Dropout), in which the dropout layers are reformanulated as random variables with Bernoulli distribtion.
    and as in \textcolor{red}{cite here and swaroop work} that training with dropout layers can be formulated as VI and predictive uncertainty can be calculated during inference by applying MC-Dropout during inference.
    The other flavour of MC-Dropout is the random incoming activations to the node are dropped instead of nodes themselves and this methods is called Monte Carlo Dropconnect (MC-Dropconnect) as proposed in \textcolor{red}{cite}.
    An example of MC-Dropout and MC-Dropconnect is depecited in Figure \textcolor{red}{cite}.

    Another method for estimating uncertinty is flipout as proposed in \textcolor{red}{cite}.
    Although flipout was proposed to decorrelate gradients in a minibatch by sampling independent weight perturbations for each example, it is used for variational inference as in \textcolor{red}{cite}.
    Sampling methods also called as Monte Carlo methods (not to be confused to Monte Carlo Dropout or Monte Carlo Dropconnect) estimate uncertainty without any approximation of parametric model.
    The most popular method in the category of sampling methods is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling proposed in \textcolor{red}{cite}.
    Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is an another variant of MCMC method and is considered as gold standard algorithm for Bayesian inference as stated in \textcolor{red}{cite}.
    Laplace approximaiton methods make use of second order Tayler series approximation to estimate $p(\theta|x, y)$.
    Uncertianty in the laplace approximation methods is calculated by taking Hessian matrix of $log(p(\theta|x, y))$ and can be applied to existing trained neural networks as in \textcolor{red}{cite}.
    Sampling methods and laplace approimation methods arenot studied because the former is computationally expensive and later suffers from infeasibility to compute Hessian matrix for deep neural networks.
    
    
    
    \section{Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods}
    In this section, we will discuss about the existing OOD detection methods for 2D classification task and 2D semantic segmentation task.
    To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to study OOD detection for the task of 3D semantic segmentation.

    The most widely used benchmarked datasets used for 2D classficiation dataset are CIFAR-10 vs SVHN \textcolor{red}{cite}, CIFAR-10 vs LSUN \textcolor{red}{cite}, abd MNIST vs Fashion-MNIST \textcolor{red}{cite}. 
    Most of the proposed methods for OOD detection in classification tasks are threshold based methods.
    These methods employ a threshold based detector and does not see the OOD data during the training.
    The baseline method for threshold based methods is proposed in \textcolor{red}{cite}.
    \textcolor{red}{cite} uses Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) and argues that in distribtion dataset have higher softmax score and out of distribtion dataset have lower softmax score and computed as in Equation~\ref{eq:SMSP} where $f_i(x)$ is the output of neural network.
    Since the softmax scores can be overconfident \textcolor{red}{cite} proposed Out of DIstribution detector for Neural networks (ODIN) which makes use of calibrated softmax score by addition of temperature constant to softmax scores and computed as in Equation~\ref{eq:SODIN} where $f_i(x)$ is the output of neural network and $T$ is the temperature constant for calibrated softmax scores.
    In addition to calibrated softmax scores, ODIN also adds noise perturbations to the input making the training adversarial.
    ODIN needs access to the OOD samples because the finetuning of perturbation magnitude is made based on these samples.
    \begin{equation}
        S_{MSP}(x) = max_i \frac{exp(f_i(x))}{\sum^{C}_{j=1}exp(f_j(x))}  \label{eq:SMSP}
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        S_{ODIN}(x) = max_i \frac{exp(f_i(x)/T)}{\sum^{C}_{j=1}exp(f_j(x)/T)}  \label{eq:SODIN}
    \end{equation}
    \textcolor{red}{cite} has proposed a threshold based OOD detection method using the Mahalanobis distance as confidence score.
    The mahalanonis distance is calculated for every layer of the network and these individual Mahalanobis scores are combined to get confidence score.
